      Growing up in America in an Asian household, I often felt a disconnect
      with my parents. I don't think this is any particular party's fault but
      rather just a combination of growing up with different lifestyles,
      cultures, etc.</p>
    <p id ="bio1"> Upon talking to others and reading similar stories online,
      I think also in Asian households the “love language” is different and we
      don’t necessarily express our appreciation and love for each other in
      traditional Western culture methods of words of affirmation or physical
      touch. And for me, as an Asian-American, growing up in the cross-section
      of these two very different cultures and how they express love, there was
      a lot of confusion and dissonance. I feel like this sentiment of an
      emotionally broken household is feel like many immigrant children. This
      website acts as a place for people to anonymously (or not anonymously)
      share things they wish they were able to confide in their parents with.
      These can be happy, sad, good or bad. I hope it acts as an outlet and that
      you find solace in reading the shared experiences of others.
